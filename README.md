## Code examples

## To Do
As an incomplete project, there are several things to do still.
- - - -
1. Get an https URL.
With Namecheap we can get the URL name "https://tradesmith-trader.com" with a fee of $10 per year.
- https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/results/?domain=tradesmith-trader
- Johan het gesê dat ek dit verniet deur die terminal kan doen. Ek gaan daarin kyk.
  
2. Get environment variables on AWS
- Select an object in a S3 bucket and select "edit metadata".
- Die Luno besonderhede en Env Vars gaan ek encode vir 'n ekstra sekuriteit. Ek dink die key waarmee ek gaan encrypt gaan ek op 'n derde verniet sagteware stoor 'HashiCorp'.
- Die HishiCorp gaan ek maar deur AWS se KMS moet vat. Dit kos so R 90 'n jaar as ek net HashiCorp se API besonderhede daar stoor. Vir nou, gaan ek dit as nog 'n environment variable stoor.
  

3. Figure uit hoe om die api en die website te run.

## Starting Development
- Start API: npm run dev
- Starting Website: npm run serve
  
## Installing HashiCorp on your system:
To install HashiCorp on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

Add the HashiCorp GPG key:
```curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -```

Add the HashiCorp repository:
```sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"```

Update the package list:
```sudo apt-get update```

Install the HashiCorp product:
```sudo apt-get install vault```
